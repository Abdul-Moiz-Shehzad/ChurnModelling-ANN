# Customer Churn Analysis with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

This repository focuses on implementing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) from scratch to analyze customer churn using a structured dataset. The project encompasses several key tasks, including:

## Data Preprocessing
- Importing and cleaning the dataset
- Encoding categorical data (label encoding for gender and one-hot encoding for geography)
- Splitting the dataset into training and test sets
- Applying feature scaling for normalization

## Building the ANN
- Initializing the ANN and defining its architecture (input layer, hidden layers, and output layer)

## Training the ANN
- Compiling and training the model on the training set

## Making Predictions
- Evaluating the model's performance and predicting outcomes for individual observations

This project serves as a practical guide for understanding ANN concepts and their application in churn prediction, leveraging insights from Lecture 15 on ANN and CNN theory.
